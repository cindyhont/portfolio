But in this version, the particles are randomly assigned over a GLTF model as a skinned mesh instead of pre-assigned in a JSON file like Nop's version. The performance, fps, loading time, etc. are therefore immensely improved.

In this version, the particles are randomly assigned over a GLTF model as a skinned mesh instead of pre-assigned in a JSON file like Nop's version. The performance, fps, loading time, etc. are therefore immensely improved. 

For now, the positions of particles cannot be freely modified, sort of "stuck" to the skinned mesh.
