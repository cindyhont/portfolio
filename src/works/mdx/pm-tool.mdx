<p>Built by me from scratch, with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Next.js, Redux Toolkit (front end)</li>
    <li>Golang (back end)</li>
    <li>PosgreSQL</li>
</ul>
<p>
A project management tool for corporate use, inspired by Jira and Asana. 
Every task can have unlimited levels of subtask, so that the project managers of big projects can go deeply into details.
Currently it offers list view and board view (kanban).
