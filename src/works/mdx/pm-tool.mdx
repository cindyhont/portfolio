<p>Built by me from scratch and hosted on multiple servers.</p>
<p>
Inspired by Jira and Asana, the idea was to build a project management tool for corporate use.
Every task can have five levels of subtask, so that the project managers of big projects can go deeply into details. In real life, it is often for a project to have multiple levels of subtasks.
Currently it offers list view and board view (kanban).
</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>real time communication</li>
    <li>file transfer</li>
    <li>authentication</li>
    <li>image editing</li>
    <li>drag and drop modules</li>
</ul>
